Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it\nover afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its\nwaistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice\nstarted to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran\nacross the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see\nit pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge [...]",
